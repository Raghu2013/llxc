LLXC is a script for working with LXC containers using python3-lxc.

What currently works:
    * Starting containers
    * Stopping containers
    * Listing containers
    * Destroying containers (via lxc-destroy)
    * Creating containers (via lxc-create)

What doesn't work yet:
    * Detailed container status
    * Entering containers
    * Executing commands in containers
    * Freezing containers
    * Unfreezing containers

What probably won't work:
    * SSH Key management, kernel user namespace patches make it kind of obsolete

Depends:
    * lxc, at least 0.8.0~rc1
    * python3
    * python3-lxc
    * python3-crypto

Planned Fixes:
    * The command line parsing is currently broken... I'll get to that :)

Requirements:

 * Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 * LXC 0.8.0-rc1 (available from the stgraber ppa)
 * python3-lxc (available from the stgraber experimental ppa)

stgraber PPA: https://launchpad.net/~stgraber/+archive/experimental/+packages

How to use:

 * llxc create test01
 * llxc list
 * llxc destroy test01

It doesn't currently configure ssh, you have to do that manually, or you can
connect to the console of the container using "lxc-console -n test01"

This document is an early work in progress.
